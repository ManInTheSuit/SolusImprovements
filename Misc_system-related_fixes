#
## Go into Settings and change settings to your liking
There's a lot of settings there that are self-explanatory.
I won't list them all here, but hopefully you'll be able to figure out which ones you don't want.

#
## Go into Budgie Desktop settings and disable animations
For more responsive system. They also might cause performance issues if enabled.

#
## Change Nautilus sidebar default folder locations
In your home folder, inside .config theres a file called user-dirs.dirs, just edit that file to your liking. Heres a copy of mine

XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"
XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/Downloads"
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/Templates"
XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/Public"
XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/Documents"
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/Music"
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Pictures"
XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/Videos"

You can also add folders/files as bookmarks.

#
## Make sound output to speakers by default (if there some issues with auto-selecting HDMI as output)
Set the default output sink

To list the output sinks available, type the following command:

$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'name:' -e 'index:'

  * index: 0
	name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo>
    index: 1
	name: <combined>

The * in front of the index indicates the current default output.

To set a system wide default, add the source name in the default.pa file:

/etc/pulse/default.pa

...
set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo (change of course to match your settings)
...

When done then you can logout/login or restart PulseAudio manually for these changes to take effect.

#
## Screen going to sleep after 10 minutes, even with all power/screensaver settings disabled
xset -DPMS (disables DPMS power saving utility)

#
## Remove GNOME terminal, install Tilix/different terminal
Self-explanatory, so far there haven't been any breakages because of this.
Also, create a symlink from gnome-terminal to tilix/different terminal (/usr/bin)

#
## Screenshotting
GNOME screenshotter is buggy, use Flameshot as substitute.
Though Flameshot doesn't capture fullscreen apps, another bug-consider an alternative.

#
## Printer setup
For scanning, install simple-scanner.

For printing:
Install hplip package. Run hp-setup, get the plugin the app wants you to do (this might take a while). Reboot, then go to printers app and add a printer there. 

#
## Install Viewnior as default Photo viewer
Self-explanatory.

#
## IBus (for Chinese)
Install libpinyin and pinyin but DO NOT add Chinese to languages when you run ibus-setup. Add chinese keyboard in Settings. 
You'll need to make an ibus daemon, it's best explained on Arch wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus

NOTE: You need a font that can support Hanzi, a good one I use is Noto Sans.

#
## Keybindings
This one is also according to your preferences, I prefer to use Super key in combination with letters/numbers for shortcuts/commands.

#
## Install dconf editor and tinker around with it
Dconf editor is a graphical editor for GNOME's gsettings. It might daunting at first, but go through all the folders (without changing anything until you familiarize yourself with it) and see which settings are available. There are a lot of neat settings exposed here that you might want to change to your liking. I like to set default IBus keyboard to my own (instead of Chinese), change window resize and move key modifier to Super instead of Alt etc.
