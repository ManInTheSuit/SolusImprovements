# Make sound output to speakers by default (if there some issues with auto-selecting HDMI as output)
Set the default output sink

To list the output sinks available, type the following command:

$ pacmd list-sinks | grep -e 'name:' -e 'index:'

  * index: 0
	name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo>
    index: 1
	name: <combined>

The * in front of the index indicates the current default output.

To set a system wide default, add the source name in the default.pa file:

/etc/pulse/default.pa

...
set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_04_01.0.analog-stereo (change of course to match your settings)
...

When done then you can logout/login or restart PulseAudio manually for these changes to take effect.

# Screen going to sleep after 10 minutes, even with all power/screensaver settings disabled
xset -DPMS (disables DPMS power saving utility)
# To persist the change on boot, put it in ~/.xprofile
