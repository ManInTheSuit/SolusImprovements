Install cpupower utility.

Verify available CPU governors.

$ sudo cpupower -c all frequency-info

Set CPU governor to the target state (powersave in this example).

$ sudo cpupower -c all frequency-set -g powersave

Verify that the change is in effect.

$ sudo cpupower -c all frequency-info

Create systemd service file to set CPU governor at system boot.

$ cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cpupower.service
[Unit]
Description=CPU powersave

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cpupower -c all frequency-set -g powersave

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

Notice that I have used oneshot process start-up type as I only want to execute an action without keeping active process.

Reload systemd manager configuration.

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Enable service at boot time.

$ sudo systemctl enable cpupower.service

Additional notes

Read systemd.service â€” Service unit configuration and cpupower manual page for further information.

Inspect /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu?/cpufreq/ directories if you want to directly use sysfs virtual file system provided by the Linux kernel.
